## Office Hours
I'm going to be holding weekly Office Hours for people who want to improve at computer programming. This is targeted towards beginners to advanced beginners.

These will be hour-long sessions over Zoom. I'll do my best to answer your questions in your learning or projects.

<a href="mailto:newyork.anthonyng@gmail.com?Subject=Office Hours">Send me an email</a> telling me about yourself and what you'd like to work on. I'll respond back telling you if I can help, and then schedule a meeting.
